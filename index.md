## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the School of EECS, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am honored to be advised by Prof. [Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/) as a research intern at the [HMI Lab](https://pku-hmi-lab.github.io/HMI-Web/about.html), School of Computer Science, Peking University.

My current research interests primarily lie in **multimodal learning** and **embodied AI**, with a focus on **world model**. Specifically, my research interests are dedicated to exploring robust and efficient methodologies for representing world states and modeling state transitions, with the overarching goal of advancing robotic planning capabilities. I am enthusiastic about contributing to and collaborating on innovative, cutting-edge research in this field.

***I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities starting in Fall 2026. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work or potential collaboration!***

## Research Interests

- **Multimodal Learning:** video understanding, VLM, video generation
- **Embodied AI:** robot planning, VLA models, robot manipulation
